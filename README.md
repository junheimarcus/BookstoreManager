# Bookstore Manager

## Overview
A Java console application developed as part of my "Introduction to Software Development" MSc coursework. The program models a bookstore, reads book data from a CSV file, and provides a summary and statistics on the books.

## Functionality
- Set a bookstore name.
- Import book data from a CSV file.
- View all books in the inventory with details.
- Display statistics:
  - Highest-value book
  - Oldest book
  - Average book value
- Menu-driven console interface.

## Java Features Learned
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and method overriding.
- Java Collections Framework: using `ArrayList` to store and manage objects.
- File I/O: reading and parsing CSV files with `Scanner`.
- Data formatting with `DecimalFormat` and `String.format`.
- Implementing search and calculation algorithms.
- User interaction through console menus.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience designing and implementing a modular Java application.
- Developed skills in managing and organizing data using collections.
- Learned to read and parse external data files efficiently.
- Practiced implementing algorithms for searching, sorting, and calculating statistics.
- Improved ability to create clear and user-friendly console interfaces.
- Strengthened understanding of OOP principles and clean coding practices.
